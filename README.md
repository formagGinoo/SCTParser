# SCTParser

### What is this

This is a small program that is able to **parse** the custom images format (**.sct**) used in games made with **Yuna Engine (SuperCreative engine)** like *Chaos Zero Nightmare (tested)* and *Epic Seven (not tested)*.

The program should support both SCT and SCT2 versions of the format.
